This library contains nine different groups of instances of the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP). Each group consists of 20 instances.

The parameters used to create these instances are encoded in the filename as follows: These instances are based on real distances 
collected from randomly chosen UK cities as the below figure shows. The first number in the file name after UK shows the number of 
nodes contained in the instance. The second is the order number of the instance within the group.

The format of each file is as given below:

Number of Customers

Vehicle Curb Weight Maximum Payload - in kg

Minimum Maximum Speed Level - in km/h

Distance Section - in metres
