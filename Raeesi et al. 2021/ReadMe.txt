Dataset Description


This dataset contains all instances used in the paper "Coordinated routing of electric commercial vehicles with intra-route recharging and en-route battery swapping", Raeesi, R. and Zografos, K. G., published in the  "European Journal of Operational Research". 

The folder includes also a pdf document (i.e. Online Supplementary Document) which contains details of the computational results presented in the paper.

The EVRPTW-RS-SMBS instances of sizes 5, 10, 25 and 100 are given in the folder "Instances" and their best found solutions reported in the paper (either the CPLEX optimal/near optimal solutions to small sized instances or the best solution found by the MG-DP-ILNS algorithm) are given in the folder "Solutions".

Note that the sequence of visits in the routes given in the solutions are based on the node IDs in the corresponding instance file.

The folder "Case Study Data" also contains data generated in the Greater London and Southeast England. This contains the lat-lon coordinates of nodes and the constructed distance matrices based on the ground driving distances returned by Bing Maps Navigation.

The files are best to be viewed in a WordPad.
